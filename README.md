### Weather-Dashboard

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

This assignment was to create a weather dashboard that gives the current weather and the five day weahter forecast based onwhat city the user inputs into the seach field. While there was some styling required, the functionality of the app was the most important and challenging part of the assignment. I did use tailwind within my HTML TO place the sections on the page as desired. The JavaScript component utilized local storage and web API's to retrieve and save weather information. Not only was the weather conditions displayed on the page, but also a weather icon. Learning how to append all this information was challenging but very interesting. In the end I created a fully functional weather dashboard forecast.
